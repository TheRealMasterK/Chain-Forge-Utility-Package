# ChainForge: Web3 Smart Contract Deployment Utility

**ChainForge** is a cutting-edge utility designed specifically for Web3 smart contract deployment and management. With its intuitive features and streamlined processes, **ChainForge** not only simplifies the complexities of Web3 development but also significantly reduces the time required for deployment and management tasks.

## Key Features

1. **Rapid Smart Contract Deployment**: ChainForge's deployment utility, powered by the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework, ensures swift and seamless deployment of your smart contracts. Dive into the deployment script [here](https://github.com/TheRealMasterK/Web3-Sc-package-utility/blob/main/scripts/deploy.js).

2. **Efficient Folder Management**: With ChainForge's recursive folder deletion utility, you can effortlessly manage and clean up unnecessary files or folders in your project, saving you valuable time in project maintenance. Check out the deletion script [here](https://github.com/TheRealMasterK/Web3-Sc-package-utility/blob/main/utilities/del.js).

## How to Use ChainForge

### Rapid Smart Contract Deployment

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory.
2. Execute the `deploy.js` script to swiftly deploy your smart contracts. This script handles the deployment of multiple contracts, including `RuffTokenFactory`, `RufferalToken`, and `DummyToken`.
3. Post-deployment, ChainForge automatically saves the contract addresses and ABI files, further reducing manual post-deployment tasks.

### Efficient Folder Management

1. Head over to the `utilities` directory.
2. Modify the `del.js` script to specify the paths of the folders you wish to delete.
3. Run the `del.js` script to delete the specified folders efficiently.
